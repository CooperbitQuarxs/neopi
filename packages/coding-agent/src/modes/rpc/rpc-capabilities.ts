 * Optional features advertised in the RPC `ready` frame's `capabilities` array.

 * commands/frames, and never rename one: a renamed string silently turns the

 *
 * One string per line, each tagged with its issue, keeps concurrent additions
 * merge-friendly (the trailing comments also stop the formatter folding it).
